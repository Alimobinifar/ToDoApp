How to Run the Application
Hello! 👋
To run this application, please follow these steps:

1.Before running the application, make sure to install the following NuGet packages:

Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore:
	Core ORM functionality for working with databases using Entity Framework.

Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design:
	Required for design-time features such as migrations and scaffolding.

Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer:
	Enables Entity Framework Core to work with SQL Server databases.

UUID.Serialization.Entity

You can install these packages via the NuGet Package Manager or use the following commands in the Package Manager Console:
Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
Install-Package UUID.Serialization.Entity

2. Configure the Database
The database configuration is located in the Data folder inside the AppDbContext.cs file.
If you're using a local SQL Server instance, your connection string should look like this:
optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer("Server=YourServerName;Database=YourDatabaseName;Integrated Security=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;");
Make sure to replace YourServerName and YourDatabaseName with your actual SQL Server instance name and the desired database name.

3. Application Responses
To handle and return responses to the user, a custom ViewModel named AppResult has been used.
This class is responsible for structuring API or service responses consistently.
